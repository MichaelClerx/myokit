Publication tests
=================
The files in this directory are adaptations of examples distributed with
 publications.
They are included in the test to check for SYNTAX ERRORS or CHANGES IN THE API.
This means the output they generate is not very important (although it can
 serve as a visual aid to find bugs).
More importantly, they should all run without errors, for at least a couple of
 major revisions after the version of Myokit the files were published with.

Update 2017-11-23
-----------------
Had to make some changes to DataLog, causing the 2nd parameter estimation
 example to fail.
Have adjusted the test file here, but the one published with the paper no
 longer works with Myokit 1.26.0+
